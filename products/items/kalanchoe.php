        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Kalanchoe plants are thick leaved succulents that are often seen in florist shops or garden centres. Most end up as potted plants but areas that can mimic their native land of Madagascar can grow them outdoors.</p>
        <p>While usually grown as a house plant, the succulent perennials of the Kalanchoe family can grow outside in regions with warm or mild winters. Some kalanchoe varieties are sold as annuals and discarded after the flowers fade.</p>
        <p>Dense clusters of tiny fragrant yellow flowers appear in spring on this vigorous, easy to grow ground cover. After blooming is finished enjoy the silvery coloured, evergreen leaves.</p>
