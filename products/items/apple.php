        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p>Use a balanced fertilizer every three months until the tree begins to bear fruit, and apply nitrogen annually
            once the tree is mature. Typically dormant during the winter, custard apple trees do not require regular
            watering.
            They do, however, need watering twice a month starting in early spring, when they are actively growing. Use
            a water timer or drip irrigation system to supply custard apple trees with a sufficient amount of water.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            Use a water timer or drip irrigation system to supply custard apple trees with a sufficient amount of water.
            Overwatering the tree can lead to root rot, while under watering it can cause the leaves to fall and the
            fruit to burn in direct sunlight. Custard apple trees are sensitive to frost.

Water- Water the plant when 1-2 inch surface layer soil feels dry to touch. Do not over water the plant 4. Sunlight - Plant grow outdoor require more than 6 hours of direct bright sunlight. 5. Germination- seeds will start germinate within 30 -40 days. 6. Fertilizer - Apply any organic fertilizer during the main growing season feed the plant with organic fertilizer once a month.
