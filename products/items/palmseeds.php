        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p>Allamanda grows very rapidly and needs pruning due to its bushy nature. Also pruning increases air
            circulation in plant required for good growth.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            Allamanda is a bushy nature plant, the large sized container is preferable as the plant gets heavy with the
            time. You may need to repot it every year. Regardless of size, make sure container has drainage holes at the
            bottom to ensure smooth drainage of water. Put stone or brick pieces on the holes.</p>
