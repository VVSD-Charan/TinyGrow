        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>1 packet contains approximately 35 seeds of Capsicum.</p>
        <p>Bell peppers are one of the most popular vegetables grown in home gardens. The bell pepper is native to
            Central and North America and is easy to grow. There is now a much wider variety of peppers to choose from
            with different colours and even different shapes.</p>
        <p>Peppers are a tender, warm-season crop. They resist most pests and offer something for everyone: spicy, sweet
            or hot, and a variety of colors, shapes and sizes. For this page, we will focus on sweet bell peppers.</p>

        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Water one to two inches per week, but remember peppers are extremely heat sensitive</li>
            <li>If you live in a warm or desert climate, watering everyday may be necessary</li>
            <li>Soil should be well-drained, but maintain adequate moisture either with mulch or plastic covering</li>
            <li>For larger fruit, spray the plants with a solution of one tablespoon of Epsom salts in a gallon of
                water, once when it begins to bloom, and once ten days later</li>
            <li>They may not be ideal for tomatoes, but they are just the thing for peppers</li>

        </p>
        <h3>Capsicum Green care</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>The temperature must be at least 70 degrees F for seed germination, so keep them in a warm area for the
                best and fastest results</li>
            <li>Let the remaining two pepper plants spend their entire lives together as one plant</li>
            <li>Northern gardeners can warm up the soil by covering it with black plastic</li>
            <li>Put two or three matchsticks in the hole with each plant, along with about a teaspoon of fertilizer</li>
            <li>The leaves of two plants help protect peppers against sunscald, and the yield is often twice as good as
                two segregated plants</li>

        <h3>Capsicum Green Special Features</h3>
        <p>For maximum flavour, eat peppers on the same day they are picked. You can also leave them on a kitchen
            counter for a day or two to ripen further.
            Do not place peppers in the crisper drawer or in plastic wrap or bags in the refrigerator. Peppers are
            warm-weather fruits and do not store well in cold temperatures. If you have too many peppers, consider the
            following storage options.
