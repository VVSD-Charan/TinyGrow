        <ul>
            <li>Water generously for the first few days</li>
            <li>Water well throughout growing season, about 2 inches per week during the summer</li>
            <li>To help tomatoes through periods of drought, find some flat rocks and place one next to each plant</li>
            <li>The rocks pull up water from under the ground and keep it from evaporating into the atmosphere</li>
            <li>Fertilize two weeks prior to first picking and again two weeks after first picking</li>
            <li>If using stakes, prune plants by pinching off suckers so that only a couple stems are growing per stake</li>
            <li>Practice crop rotation from year to year to prevent diseases that may have over wintered</li>
            <li>Tomatoes should not be planted outdoors until day and night temperatures are about 55 degrees</li>
