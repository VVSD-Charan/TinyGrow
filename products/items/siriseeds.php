        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Common Name: white siris, Acacia procera (Roxb.) Willd, Albizzia procera nom. illeg, Mimosa elata Roxb, Mimosa procera Roxb, Tall albizia.</p>
        <p>Safed Siris (Albizia procera) is a deciduous tree with a very irregular ovoid crown. The tree is commonly found on alluvial ground along streams, and in moist even swampy places. It is particularly common in low lying moist Savannahs.</p>
        <p>It is fairly drought resistant but frost-tender. It produces root suckers when the stem is mutilated or the tree becomes old.</p>

        <h3>Siris Plant Special Features</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Depression: In a similar vein to the health benefit above, albizia also improves mood by rebalancing hormones in the body and soothing the nervous system, which can often complicate hormonal levels.</li>
            <li>Sleep Aid: If you suffer from sleeplessness or insomnia, a decoction of albizia may be just the ticket to a good night’s sleep. Beyond soothing the nerves and mind, it also calms the body and helps stimulate long-lasting restful sleep.</li>
            <li>Respiratory Distress: For those who suffer from asthma, allergies, or chronic respiratory conditions, albizia can significantly help by eliminating inflammation in those sinuses and tracts, thereby reducing the impulse to cough or wheeze.</li>
            <li>This can help to speed up recovery time and generally improve the health of your respiratory system, even in the midst of an asthmatic attack.</li>
        </ul>
