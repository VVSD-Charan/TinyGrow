Tall and course, the plants have creeping or tuberous roots and large, bristly leaves. Today, varieties have even been developed for small spaces and containers.</p>

They make excellent cut flowers and many are attractive to bees and birds.Smaller plants with big-time flower power. Striking compact, low-growing sunflower fills vase after beautiful vase with luminous, long-stemmed, brown-eyed, golden flowers. </p>

        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Water plants deeply but infrequently to encourage deep rooting</li>
            <li>Feed plants only sparingly; over-fertilization can cause stems to break in the fall</li>
            <li>Tall species and cultivars require support</li>
            <li>Bamboo stakes are a good choice for any plant that has a strong, single stem and needs support for a short period of time</li>
            <li>Sunflowers grow best in locations with direct sun (6 to 8 hours per day); they prefer long, hot summers to flower well</li>
