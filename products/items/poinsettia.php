        <p>The poinsettia is a commercially important plant species of the diverse spurge family.</p>
        <p>The poinsettia is a commercially important plant species of the diverse spurge family. The species is indigenous to Mexico. It is particularly well known for its red and green foliage and is widely used in Christmas floral displays.</p>

                <h6>How to maintain Poinsettia plants?</h6>
                <p>Light: Poinsettias need a indirect bright light. Waterless (about once a week) when the top layer of the soil (1-2 inch) feels dry to touch ,after the blooms and leaves drop or shrivel. The plant needs this rest period after its blooming season. Cut back the stems to half their size in March or April. When new growth begins to appear, its safe to resume a more normal watering and feeding schedule. Use regular houseplant food, and follow the manufacturers instructions. Move the plant outdoors when the outside nighttime temperatures rise above 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Provide light but avoid placing it in direct sunlight. Plant the poinsettia in the ground, or leave it in the pot if you wish. Repotting may be necessary at the end of summer after the plant has grown. If the poinsettia is planted in the ground, you can expect a shrub-like plant during the summer. Pinch back new growth in June, July or August to promote a bushier plant.</p>
