        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Daily watering is essential only during hot summer days. As the flower grows in warm climates, where the temperature always remains above 50F even at night, remember to water it regularly even throughout winter months. This will allow the soil to dry out between watering.Temperature is another thing you should pay attention to. In case you live in a subtropical climate, you can place the plant indoors until cold weather passes. Adenium can also be grown outdoors in areas where the temperature never goes below 40. The desert rose can survive 40 degrees with little damage, but when the temperature is below 30, the plant dies.In winter the plant can freeze, even if it is placed in a greenhouse. There are a few tips on how to care for adenium in winter. Many people treat it like a cactus. Caring for adenium, water it only on warm sunny days and move it to the house, when there is a risk of frost.</p>
