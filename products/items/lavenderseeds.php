        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lavender has the special sweet fragrance. 1 packet contains 50 seeds of lavender - seeds.</p>
        <p>These aromatic subshrubs are popular in herb gardens as well as in the perennial border, and the intensely perfumed blue-violet, mauve, pink, or white flowers are treasured for drying and making potpourri.</p>
        <p>The foliage of Lavender is a standout in the garden where its silvery or gray-green hues contrast nicely with its neighbors. A tough plant for sunny dry spots and one of the longest-blooming tough semi-shrubs around, lavender (genus Lavandula) would find a place in most sunny gardens.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lavender is a woody subshrub, and pruning techniques should reflect this</li>
            <li>Do not prune in spring until new growth appears, and leave plants alone for the winter</li>
            <li>Plants may be sheared back and shaped after flowering, but do not cut low into old wood</li>
            <li>If older plants become unsightly, cut back by a third every three years</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lavender Plant care</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Soak it deeply in the evenings, daily until planted, then water again for about an hour before planting, and of course, after as well</li>
            <li>Prune the top of the plant to ensure a productive plant</li>
            <li>Loosen the roots from the potting soil by working the trowel teeth into the soil block</li>
            <li>Place plant just above the blend of stone/ lime / bonemeal / compost, not allowing the roots to touch the blend and gather soil around base of plant</li>
            <li>Water deeply</li>
