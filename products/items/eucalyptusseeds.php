        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Eucalyptus plants are evergreen trees and shrubs in the genus Eucalyptus and family Myrtaceae.</p>
        <p>Eucalyptus is a genus of ornamental plants with attractive aromatic leaves. Although eucalyptus trees are enormous, many eucalyptus plants can grow in pots and make stunning indoor houseplants. The round or lance-shaped eucalyptus leaves are useful for drying to create dried eucalyptus bunches to enhance your interior décor.</p>
        <p>Eucalyptus leaves contain large amounts of essential oils. The intense spicy scents and cooling effect are reasons why crushed eucalyptus leaves and eucalyptus oil are popular in aromatherapy.</p>

    <!-- Planting and care -->
    <div class="container care">
        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p>Eucalyptus trees and shrubs grow in the ground, and they also grow in large pots or containers outdoors or indoors.
            If you live in USDA zones 8 through 11, you can grow eucalyptus shrubs and trees in the ground or pots outdoors. The ideal temperature range for growing eucalyptus is 65°F to 71°F (18°C – 22°C). All you need to grow outdoor eucalyptus plants is to choose a sunny location.
            If you live in colder climates, you can easily grow potted eucalyptus plants indoors. Take the pots outdoors in the summer. Then bring them back inside in the fall to protect the plant from the cold.</p>

                <h6>Can Eucalyptus Grow Indoors?</h6>
                <p>Eucalyptus plants grow well indoors if they get plenty of sunlight. Potted eucalyptus plants are ideal for growing in containers as perennials or annuals. But it’s good to remember that eucalyptus plants are fast-growing trees, and some species can grow at a rate of up to 8 ft. (2 m) in one season.</p>
