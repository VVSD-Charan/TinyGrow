        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Canna lilies are low maintenance and easy to grow, and both their flowers and foliage offer long-lasting color in the garden.</p>
        <p>These perennials come in a vast variety of color and boast immense, often-veined, paddle-shaped leaves and sheathing leafstalks in shades of green or bronze.Originally from the West Indies and South America, cannas are one of the showiest summer bulbs you can grow.</p>
        <p>These lush tropical plants produce large sometimes colourful leaves, and tall flower stalks with vibrant blossoms.Depending on the variety, cannas can grow a few feet tall to more than 10 feet tall. Dwarf varieties look great in large containers combined with petunias, sweet potato vines, and other low-growing annuals.Larger varieties make a strong, elegant statement planted at the back of flower beds or grouped together in showy islands of colour.Because they tolerate moist soils, cannas can also be planted along ponds or in a wet spot in the yard.

        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p>Cannas do best with a good supply of water, so water the plants during the summer if the rainfall is less than 1 inch per week. Keep a thin layer of mulch around cannas to help retain moisture as well.Stake tall varieties if needed.As flowers fade, deadhead to promote continued flowering.</p>
        <p>When growing cannas in the garden, placing them in mixed borders or group plantings will offer the most dramatic effect.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Cannas like moist conditions too, but will tolerate nearly any well-draining soil that is either neutral or slightly acidic. They appreciate bog-like conditions as well. The soil should also be rich in organic matter.</p>
