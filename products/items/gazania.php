        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>If you are looking for a showy annual bloom in the sunny garden or the container, something you can just plant and forget about, try growing Gazanias.</p>
        <p>Care of Gazania flowers is limited and often non-existent if you have neither the time nor the inclination to care for them. Botanically called Gazania rigens, treasure flowers is a more common name. The plant is often referred to as the African daisy.</p>
